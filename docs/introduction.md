Kitbag/router is a bold attempt to unseat the official router for Vue.js. Fundamentally, it solves the same problem but aims to do so in a typesafe and developer friendly way.

:white_check_mark: Nested routes mapping  
:white_check_mark: Dynamic Routing  
:white_check_mark: Modular, component-based router configuration  
:white_check_mark: Route params, query, wildcards **(not wildcards!)**  
:white_check_mark: View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system  
:white_check_mark: Fine-grained navigation control  
:white_check_mark: Links with automatic active CSS classes **(todo!)**  
:x: HTML5 history mode or hash mode  
:white_check_mark: Customizable Scroll Behavior **(todo!)**  
:white_check_mark: Proper encoding for URLs **(todo?)**  

If you're interested in what it would take to switch, take a look at our [guide](/migrating-vue-router) on migrating from vue-router.
